Validation is crucial part of any website because there are always few pages need information from user side. Using validation provided information format is much structured, e.g. email, using validation user will enter email in proper format so ther eare less chances of wrong infomation added by user. Like wise we will put validation for other required field being used for form. 

Here i have create simple example using React Redux-form with validation. Here i have used options for login and sign up most commonly being used for all kind of websites.
